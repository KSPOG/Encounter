# PokeMMO Encounter Counter

This project provides a desktop counter for PokeMMO encounters using Java.
It watches the PokeMMO client window and uses OCR to identify the Pokémon
currently encountered.

## Features
- Tray tip showing the name of each encountered Pokémon
- Optional automatic reset when a shiny is found
- Notifications for shiny and legendary encounters
- Displays the most recent shiny encounter

## Building
Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed, then run:

```
mvn package
```

## Running
```
java -cp target/encounter-counter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.pokemmo.encounter.EncounterCounter
```

Adjust the capture area and configure Tesseract if needed. The OCR engine
looks for a tessdata folder relative to the working directory. To override
this or specify a language, provide JVM system properties when launching:

```
java -Dtessdata.path=/path/to/tessdata -Dtess.language=eng \
  -cp target/encounter-counter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  com.pokemmo.encounter.EncounterCounter
```

Alternatively, set the `TESSDATA_PREFIX` environment variable before running
the application.
