# PokeMMO Encounter Counter

This project provides a desktop counter for PokeMMO encounters using Java.
It watches the PokeMMO client window and uses OCR to identify the Pokémon
currently encountered.

## Features
- Tray tip showing the name of each encountered Pokémon
- Optional automatic reset when a shiny is found
- Notifications for shiny and legendary encounters
- Displays the most recent shiny encounter

## Building
Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed, then run:

```
mvn package
```

## Running
```
java -cp target/encounter-counter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.pokemmo.encounter.EncounterCounter
```

Adjust the capture area and configure Tesseract if needed. The OCR engine
requires access to Tesseract's language data. By default it looks for a
`tessdata` directory in the working directory. To point it elsewhere or
specify a language, provide JVM system properties when launching:

```
java -Dtessdata.path=/path/to/tesseract -Dtess.language=eng \
  -cp target/encounter-counter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  com.pokemmo.encounter.EncounterCounter
```

Where `/path/to/tesseract` is the parent directory containing the `tessdata`
folder (not the folder itself). You may also set the `TESSDATA_PREFIX`
environment variable to this parent directory. If no language data is found,
OCR is disabled and encounters will not be detected.
